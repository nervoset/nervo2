yaml:
  instruction: |
    I am asking you to process this yaml file, which is a series of questions we call them prompts,
    where each subsequent question adds more details to the previous one, 
    essentially creating a chain of linked questions. 
    Your task is to answer each question in sequence, 
    and then improve or refine the answer based on the additional details provided by the next question.
    So, you will start by answering the first question, 
    then combine that answer with the details in the second question to improve the response, 
    and continue this process until you have worked through the entire chain of questions, refining the answer each time.
    Please provide only final answer after going through and combining all results together

  prompts:

    prompt_2: The project has to be written on rust
    prompt_3:
